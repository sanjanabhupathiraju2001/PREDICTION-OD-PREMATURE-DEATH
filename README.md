# PREDICTION-OD-PREMATURE-DEATH
This project aimed to develop a predictive model to forecast premature deaths per 100 thousand population across various counties in the USA, and identify the key factors that contribute to such deaths.  The best-performing model was Random Forest with hyperparameters (Grid Search), with the least values of MAE, MSEr, and RMSE.
